# wine quality check
Introduction
Wine quality prediction is a classic problem in the field of machine learning. This project aims to create a predictive model using historical data of wine characteristics. The model will help in assessing the quality of wine based on its chemical properties.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various features like acidity, chlorides, pH, alcohol content, etc., along with the quality rating.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt. You can install them using the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
Install the required libraries:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions:
bash
jupyter notebook Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb
or

bash
python wine_quality_prediction.py
Model
The project uses various classification models to predict wine quality. The primary models explored are:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The models are trained on the preprocessed dataset, and their performances are compared to select the best model.

Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics help in understanding the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

Results
The final model selected is the Random Forest Classifier, which provides the best performance among the models tested. The results and visualizations of the predictions are included in the Jupyter notebook.
